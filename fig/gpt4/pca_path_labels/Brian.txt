check the transaction history and the receipts to see if a mistake was made when giving change or entering the amount.
ask the employees who were working that day if they noticed anything unusual or if they made a mistake while using the register.
check the nearby areas, trash bins, or floors in case the money accidentally fell or was misplaced.
review the CCTV footage, if available, to see if there was any theft or mishandling of money at the register.
report the discrepancy to the owner or their superior, honestly explaining the situation and asking for advice or help to resolve the issue.
pay the missing amount from their own pocket to balance the register, but this should be the last resort and only if they cannot find any other solution.
