This is the story of a man named Neil Fisk, and how he came to love God. The pivotal
event in Neil’s life was an occurrence both terrible and ordinary: the death of his wife,
Sarah. Neil was consumed with grief after she died, a grief that was excruciating not only
because of its intrinsic magnitude, but because it also renewed and emphasized the
previous pains of his life. Her death forced him to reexamine his relationship with God,
and in doing so he began a journey that would change him forever.
Neil was born with a congenital abnormality that caused his left thigh to be
externally rotated and several inches shorter than his right; the medical term for it was
proximal femoral focus deficiency. Most people he met assumed God was responsible for
this, but Neil’s mother hadn’t witnessed any visitations while carrying him; his condition
was the result of improper limb development during the sixth week of gestation, nothing
more. In fact, as far as Neil’s mother was concerned, blame rested with his absent father,
whose income might have made corrective surgery a possibility, although she never
expressed this sentiment aloud.
