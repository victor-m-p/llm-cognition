5. to stay positive and keep their spirits up. A positive attitude can help them stay focused and make the best decisions in a challenging situation.
6. to find shelter immediately. Staying exposed to harsh weather conditions should lead to hypothermia. They should look for a natural shelter such as a cave or use branches and leaves to build a makeshift tent.

3. gather firewood and start a fire, both for warmth and to serve as a signal for potential rescue crews.
4. keep their spirits up and stick together. It's important to stay positive and united in such difficult circumstances, as panic and despair can lead to poor decision-making.
5. ration their remaining food and water to ensure it lasts for as long as possible. They should also attempt to find water by melting snow or finding a stream.
6. make a detailed plan for what to do if the rescue crew does not arrive soon. This might include deciding on a route to try to hike out or searching for more sustainable food and water sources.

3. keep a positive attitude. Despite the tough situation, it's important to remain hopeful and support each other. This can help them stay mentally strong and focused on survival.
4. try to make a fire. Fire can provide heat to keep them warm, boil water to make it safe to drink, cook food, and serve as a signal to rescuers.
5. conserve their energy. They should avoid unnecessary physical activities and try to rest as much as possible to maintain their strength. This is also why it's essential to stay in one place rather than trying to walk out of the wilderness.
6. find or build a shelter to protect themselves from the harsh weather conditions. It should be as simple as a lean-to made from branches and leaves, or a snow cave if there's sufficient snow.

1. stay warm. Hypothermia is a real risk in the cold wilderness. They should find or create shelter, bundle up in whatever clothing or materials they have, and huddle together for body warmth if necessary.
2. remain calm and composed. Panic can lead to poor decision making. They need to conserve their energy and think clearly about their next steps.
3. try to find higher ground, if possible and safe. From a higher vantage point, they can potentially see signs of civilization or a way out of the wilderness. It will also increase their visibility to rescuers.
4. signal for help. This should be through creating a visible sign in the wilderness, like a large SOS in the snow or a signal fire. They should also make noise periodically to attract attention, especially from any potential rescue helicopters or teams in the area.
5. remain where they are, rather than wandering aimlessly. Unless they have a clear sense of direction or target, they're more likely to get even more lost and use up their energy unnecessarily. Rescue crews will have an easier time locating them if they stay put.
6. ration what little food and water they have left, only consuming small amounts at regular intervals. They should also seek out additional sources of water, such as melting snow or ice.

2. to stay positive and keep one another's spirits up. Maintaining a positive and hopeful attitude can help them to better deal with the situation and reduce panic.
3. ration their remaining food and water. Given the uncertainty of when help would arrive, it is crucial to make sure their supplies last as long as possible. They should only eat and drink small amounts at a time.
4. keep a lookout for any signs of rescuers. This would entail watching and listening for helicopters, planes, or any rescue teams on foot. If they hear or see anything, they should try to make their presence known by yelling, waving, or using their signal mirror.
5. to stay where they are. It is easier for a rescue team to locate them if they don't move from their original position. Moving around can also lead to getting further lost or encountering dangerous wildlife.
6. to keep warm. They need to gather firewood and start a fire for warmth, taking turns to maintain it overnight. If there is enough supply, they should use the fire smoke as a signal to attract rescuers.

He knows that a rescue crew should arrive before long, but it is extremely cold and they don't have much food or water left. Here are six suggestions for what Brad should do. Please, rank them from best to worst. Your response should be a list of numbers, in the order from best to worst, where the best is first and the worst is last.
1. to stay in one place as much as possible. If they keep moving around, it will be much harder for rescue teams to find them.
2. to try and signal for help. This might be by using a whistle or a mirror to create flashes of light, or by creating a large and unmistakable sign in the snow or on the ground.
3. to try and find or create a shelter to protect them from the cold. This should be anything from finding a cave or an overhang to building a snow cave or a lean-to out of branches.
4. to ration their remaining food and water. They don't know how long they might be stuck out there, so it's important to make what they have last as long as possible.
5. to try and find a reliable source of water. This should be a stream or river, or they should try melting snow over their fire.
6. to make a fire if they can. Not only will this help them keep warm, but it will also serve as a signal to any search and rescue teams that might be looking for them.

Please, rank them from best to worst. Your response should be a list of numbers, in the order from best to worst, where the best is first and the worst is last.
1. signal for help. They can use a whistle, flashlight, or even a fire if they have the means to start one. Smoke signals during the day and fire at night can potentially attract the attention of rescue teams or passing airplanes.
2. ration their food and water supplies. It is uncertain how long they might need to wait for rescue, hence carefully managing their resources is crucial to ensure survival.
3. stay calm. Panic can lead to poor decision-making and unnecessary risk-taking. It would be best to calmly assess their situation and make plans accordingly.
4. find or create suitable shelter. Even a basic shelter can significantly protect them from exposure to the cold, wind, and any potential precipitation. Depending on their location, they might be able to use natural formations, or they can construct a simple shelter using available materials such as branches and leaves.
5. conserve energy. In harsh, cold conditions, any unnecessary physical activity can deplete energy reserves quickly, making survival more difficult. Therefore, they should focus on maintaining body warmth and resting as much as possible.
6. keep morale high among the group. Mental strength is equally as important as physical strength in survival situations. Keeping spirits high can prevent panic, maintain cohesiveness in the group, and encourage proactive behavior. Story-telling, singing, or other team activities can help with this.
