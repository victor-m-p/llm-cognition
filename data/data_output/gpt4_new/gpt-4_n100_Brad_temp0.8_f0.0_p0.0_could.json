One thing that they could do is ration their remaining food and water. They should only consume what they absolutely need in order to preserve their supplies as long as possible.\n2. One thing that they could do is create a distress signal. This could be done by creating large visible markings in the snow or using materials to create a smoke signal if they have a way to start a fire.\n3. One thing that they could do is build a shelter. Even a basic structure can provide some protection from the elements and make the wait for rescue more bearable.\n4. One thing that they could do is find a way to collect and purify water.

It's important to keep everyone's spirits up and not lose hope, as mental strength is crucial in survival situations.", "1. One thing that they could do is to gather together as much firewood as possible before it gets too cold or dark. This will help them stay warm and also create a smoke signal to aid rescue teams in locating them. \n\n2. One thing that they could do is to ration their remaining food and water. Each member of the group should only eat or drink a small amount each day to make the supplies last longer.\n\n3. One thing that they could do is to find a way of collecting and purifying water. They may be able to melt snow or find a nearby stream and purify the water by boiling it.\n\n4. One thing that they could do is to build a shelter. Even a simple structure built from branches or other materials can help shield them from the elements.\n\n5. One thing that they could do is to try and find a high point from where they can signal for help and also have a better view of the surrounding area. \n\n6.

One thing that they could do is ration their remaining food and water supplies to make sure they last as long as possible and are evenly distributed among the group. \n\n2.

They could also start a signal fire, using green branches to create smoke that is visible from the air. \n\n3. One thing that they could do is find or build a shelter to protect themselves from the harsh weather conditions. They could use branches, leaves, and any available materials to construct a makeshift hut or cave.\n\n4. One thing that they could do is try to find a source of fresh water to stay hydrated.
