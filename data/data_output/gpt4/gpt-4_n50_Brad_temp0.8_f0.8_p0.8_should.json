One thing that Brad should do is stay calm so he can think clearly and make rational decisions.\n2. Brad should ensure everyone in the group is safe, accounted for, and uninjured.\n3. He should immediately assess their supplies to see exactly how much food, water, and equipment they have left.\n4. Brad should keep morale high by encouraging his friends and remaining positive about their situation.\n5. In order to conserve heat, he should encourage everyone to stay close together when resting or sleeping.\n6. Brad should allocate portions of food and water equally among the group members to last until help arrives.\n7. To avoid frostbite or hypothermia, he should ensure everyone is bundled up appropriately using whatever clothing or materials they have available.\n8. He should attempt to create a temporary shelter using natural resources around them like branches or leaves if possible.\n9. If there's snow around them, Brad should consider melting it for drinking water once their supply runs out but be careful not to dehydrate from eating snow directly since this could lower body temperature too much\n10. He should also try creating a visible signal such as a large SOS sign on the ground that can be seen from above by rescue choppers.\n11. Another step he could take would be setting up a controlled fire with dry wood both for warmth and signaling purposes if possible\n12. He Should routinely check on each member of his team for any signs of hypothermia like slurred speech, shivering etc., \n13 .Brad Should consider rationing energy usage by reducing unnecessary physical activities \n14 .In case there is an injury within the group , brad  must act first aid procedures accordingly based on severity of injury \n15.. Every few hours , brad  must reevaluate all plans based on changing situations .\n16.. If phone signals are accessible ,brad  must contact local authorities providing exact location details with landmarks\n17.. If necessary ,he Should discuss potential escape routes in case immediate rescue isn't happening\n18 ..He must remind everyone not leave traces behind which may attract wild animals .\n19.. Every day before dusk ,brad  must prepare shelters & fires ahead as nights might get very cold \n20 .. Finally , brad along with others must maintain hope & confidence that help will arrive soon until then survival strategies need to be implemented precisely", "1. One thing Brad should do is stay calm so as not to panic his friends.\n2. Brad should assess the amount of food and water they have left to ration it effectively among the group.\n3. Brad should attempt to signal for help, such as creating a large 'SOS' sign on the ground or using a whistle if he has one.\n4. He should search for shelter or find ways to create makeshift shelter from natural materials like branches and leaves.\n5. Brad should gather everyone's clothing layers together in order that they can share body heat more efficiently when sleeping.\n6. He should also try to start a fire both for warmth and for attracting attention from rescue crews.\n7. Brad should keep everyone physically active by doing simple exercises; this will generate heat and prevent hypothermia setting in.\n8. He should ensure that each person drinks plenty of water even if they don't feel thirsty, since dehydration can occur quickly in cold weather due to increased respiration rates.\n9. Brad should take inventory of what provisions and tools are available that may aid in their survival or help attract rescuers\n10. If there is snow around, he should melt some for drinking water once their supplies run out but only if necessary, because eating snow can lower body temperature too much if done excessively.\n11. He could arrange hikes within short distances of their base camp looking for signs of civilization or trails without straying too far off \n12.Brad  Should maintain high morale amongst his friends by reassurance about being found soon\n13.He shouldn\u2019t let anyone go alone anywhere whether its nature calls or fetching some woods etcetera .\n14.Brad  Should always know the direction from where they came ,it might be helpful finding way back \n15.He could use bright colored items like clothes,to wave around during day time which might get noticed by rescue teams  \n16.He could instruct everyone about dangers such as wildlife, falling into icy waters etcetera \n17.They Should conserve energy whenever possible instead wasting it unnecessarily\n18.Should follow any streams or rivers nearby hoping it might lead them towards civilization   \n19.If possible mark trees along your route with pieces of cloth so trailing team finds you easily    \n20.Lastly,Before night falls he must ensure all are gathered near fire keeping warm .", "1. One thing that Brad should do is stay calm, as panic can cloud judgment.\n2. He should also keep everyone together to maintain morale and ensure safety.\n3. Brad should build a shelter using natural materials available in the environment to protect against harsh weather conditions.\n4. He should try to start a fire not only for warmth but also as a potential signal for rescue crews.\n5. Brad should ration out their remaining food evenly among the group to make it last longer.\n6. He should take inventory of all supplies they have on hand so he knows exactly what resources are available.\n7. Brad should prioritize finding a water source such as a stream or snow that can be melted and boiled for drinking water.\n8. He should organize shifts within the group for keeping watch throughout the night to ensure the safety of his party from wildlife or other potential dangers.\n9. Brad should attempt first aid on any injuries within his group, no matter how minor they may seem at first glance, with whatever materials he has on hand.\n10. He should frequently check in with each member of his group emotionally, ensuring everyone's mental well-being during this stressful situation.\n\n11.Brad Should create tools or weapons by using sharp rocks or sticks, useful both for hunting and protection from predators.\n\n12.He Should focus on creating smoke signals during daylight hours when it would be most visible to search teams.\n\n13.Brad Should leave distinct markings or symbols along their path if they decide to move locations; this could help search parties find them more easily.\n\n14.If possible, he Should climb up high points in order to have better visibility and maybe spot signs of civilization like roads or settlements afar off\n\n15.Brad Should cover all members properly while sleeping, body heat can greatly help combat hypothermia during extremely cold nights\n\n16.He Should conserve energy whenever possible since malnutrition and dehydration may set in due to limited food and water supply\n\n17.If needed, brad Should look for edible plants which could supplement their food stocks; knowledge about local flora can prove crucial here \n\n18.He Should keep noise levels low especially during nights so as not attract wild animals towards them \n\n19.Brad Should regularly collect wood (if available) through day time which will come handy when making fire at night \n\n20.Lastly Brennan shouldn't lose hope even if things get tough , maintaining positivity will encourage others too plus psychologically helps endure such crisis situations better", "1. One thing Brad should do is stay calm and try to keep his group's morale up.\n2. Brad should immediately note down the last landmark or specific location they passed through before realizing they were lost.\n3. He should make sure everyone is wearing enough layers to stay warm in the cold temperatures.\n4. Brad should inventory their remaining food and water, then ration it carefully to ensure it lasts as long as possible.\n5. He should consider melting snow for drinking water, but only after ensuring it's clean and free of contaminants.\n6. Brad should look around for any sort of shelter like a cave or overhanging rocks where they could take refuge from the elements.\n7. If no natural shelter can be found, he should help his friends build one using materials available nearby like branches or leaves.\n8. One way that might help them get rescued faster is if Brad creates a signal fire; he should collect dry wood and other combustibles for this purpose.\n9. He also should remember that three fires in a row are an internationally recognized distress signal when lit at night or smoke during daytime would attract attention from afar.\n10.Brad  also needs to create some form of visible signal that rescuers can see from the air during daylight - large letters SOS made out of stones or logs can work well for this purpose\n11.He Should always maintain constant communication with his friends, reassuring them about their survival chances and keeping everyone's spirits high \n12.Brad must prioritize first aid too \u2013 he needs to attend to any injuries among members promptly using whatever supplies available\n13.He Should keep an eye on weather predictions by observing changes in sky coloration, wind direction etc., so that they can prepare accordingly\n14.If mobile connection is still active, Brad definitely must attempt contacting emergency services providing detailed information about their situation & probable location \n15.Brad ought to establish strict rules regarding staying together at all times \u2013 nobody wanders off alone increasing risk factor\n16.Considering wildlife threats may be prevalent in such wilderness areas; hence precautions against potential animal attacks are needed which includes making noise regularly & avoiding sweet smelling foods exposed outside  \n17.To retain body heat overnight especially, brad could ask everybody huddle together while sleeping acting as collective heat source   \n18.Actively looking out for edible plants/ insects / berries could supplement their dwindling food resources\u2013 brad must apply caution ensuring nothing poisonous gets ingested   \n19.If near fresh water sources like streams/rivers , he has another reason for relief- not only does it provide unlimited supply of drinking water (upon boiling),but fishing might grant them access fresh food \n20.Finally irrespective of hardships encountered brad needs cultivate patience never losing hope\u2013 rescue will eventually arrive once distress signals are noticed .", "1. One thing that Brad should do is to remain calm and avoid panic since it can lead to poor decisions.\n2. Brad should gather everyone in his group together to keep morale up and encourage each other.\n3. He should try to mark their last known location on a map if they have one, or remember landmarks.\n4. Brad should ration the remaining food and water for everyone in order to prolong their survival until rescue crews arrive.\n5. It's essential that he should find or create shelter from the harsh weather conditions of the Canadian wilderness.\n6. Brad should try to make a signal fire using any resources available, like leaves or branches, so rescuers can locate them more quickly.\n7. He also should collect snow if possible and melt it for drinking water as dehydration will exacerbate problems with cold weather exposure.\n8. Brad should ensure everyone stays active by doing small tasks, which will help fight off hypothermia by keeping their bodies warm through movement.\n9. They all should dress warmly and layer clothing items if possible; putting on everything they have at once may protect them from the cold further.\n10. If injured, Brad or anyone else in his group who needs medical attention, he must apply basic first aid immediately until professional help arrives.\n11. Another thing that Brad should do is avoid unnecessary risks such as climbing steep hillsides or crossing rushing rivers unless absolutely necessary for survival or visibility purposes only - these could result in injuries making their situation worse.\n12. To attract attention from potential rescuers, they all must make noise periodically throughout the day either by shouting or banging stones together; this might catch someone's attention during a search effort.\n\n13. In case anyone tries reaching out via walkie-talkie radios (if available), they definitely should take turns listening for signals every few hours.\n\n14.Brads' team always need rest periods but shouldn't huddle closely while sleeping \u2013 sharing body heat conserves warmth better than alone.\n\n15.If any animal approaches campsite-Brad needs reminding people not provoke it; most animals are likely scared humans too leading unnecessary confrontations thereby avoiding injuries.\n\n16.To maintain strength-Brad giving everybody light exercises do regularly without draining energy reserves unduly.\n\n17.Brad attempting fish/hunt wildlife around site survival circumstance permits-having knowledge basic skills like making snares traps advantageous here.\n\n18.They often communicating feelings each other maintaining high morale spirits-ensuring nobody succumbs despair crucial moments like these teamwork spirit positively impacts overall survival chances during tough times ahead especially team\u2019s resilience tested extreme levels already helping reduce stress/panic among members significantly eventually pulling closer unity bond!\n\n19.Whenever daylight breaks-he heading higher grounds nearby improving visibility hence increasing probability getting spotted faster rescue teams/civilian aircrafts overhead patrol region lost party members stranded currently then signaling distress visually somehow!\n\n20.Finally yet importantly albeit hard time waiting patiently ensuring stay put mainly since wandering off unknown terrain simply increases risk misadventures complications delaying imminent rescue operations underway-they\u2019re better staying collected composed focusing surviving challenging ordeal instead worrying excessively about uncertain future outcomes!", "1.
