An unconventional method would be hitchhiking \u2013 though not entirely safe, it might work favorably if time is running out fast!\n11. Using an app-based delivery service like Postmates, Josh may request someone bring him bicycle so he can pedal towards airport faster than walking pace!\n12.One interesting solution he might consider would be renting a helicopter ride!

Finding local private pilots who'd agree flying short distances - quite unconventional route indeed! \n19.Also worth considering: hiring professional driver service (if affordable) \u2013 most likely quicker response time compared being stranded road middle nowhere!\n20.Finally as last resort: dial 911 explain predicament- they usually helpful guide best possible alternatives depending individual city guidelines/rules", "1.

Another option is he might rent an electric scooter if they're available in that area and head toward the airport as long as it isn't too far away.\n9. Maybe he could use an app like Turo to quickly rent another vehicle and drive himself there instead of relying on others\n10.

He could use this opportunity to learn how to fix common car problems by looking up tutorials online using mobile data\n12.. If all else fails, he might even consider borrowing money from friends/family (if it\u2019s necessary) so that he can afford more expensive last-minute travel options \n13..

Renting motorcycles/scooters can also get you places quickly but safety concerns must first be addressed before considering this option \n18... In extreme situations where time is running short & every second counts \u2013 though very costly - private charter jets/helicopters can also get you flying without having to rely heavily on commercial airlines\u2019 rigid schedules \n19...

In less busy moments on the intersection, Josh might attempt fixing minor issues in his car himself if he has some basic knowledge about it.\n10. He might have packed travel essentials in advance; so he may choose to leave them temporarily in his locked car while arranging transport services for himself first - which will allow him quicker mobility options like motorcycles or bicycles too!\n11. Josh could look around for possible shuttle bus stops taking passengers directly toward airports from major intersections like where he\u2019s currently stuck at now - many cities offer these services regularly throughout each day! \n12.The next course of action that Josh can opt is renting out an emergency bike/scooter service available via apps nowadays \u2013 this way he won't get stuck in traffic again!\n13.He may decide calling up city police department who often provides free help during such situations especially when it involves flight-related emergencies as well\n14.Josh can explore hitchhiking opportunities with friendly strangers heading towards same direction after ensuring safety measures appropriately\n15.In order not miss any chance \u2013 even remote ones- ,he can announce loudly about needing urgent help on reaching nearest airport due early morning flight - hoping someone among passerby drivers hear him out !\n16.Another strategy that doesn\u2019t sound too traditional but effective nonetheless ; josh can pull over any delivery/ mail van coming across & request them dropping off at closest point leading towards Airport .\n17.Without losing hope , our guy here can keep trying starting engine multiple times just case something clicks & vehicle starts running unexpectedly \n18.While waiting further longer isn\u2019t much feasible yet still worth giving shot : May be during time lag between current situation & arrival of requested cab/tow truck etc ,Josh tries seeking solution by scrolling through online DIY Car repair tutorials/articles over phone internet . Who knows what works !\n19.One smart move left untouched yet : Since most popular highways /roads are equipped surveillance cameras every few meters apart hence control rooms monitoring those feeds 24*7- therefore loud honking repeatedly perhaps catch their attention signaling urgency there ! They sure have ways alerting respective authorities instantly .\n20.Finally last viable alternative one should always remember under crisis circumstances: Never hesitate praying silently until some miracle happens turning things around favorably !!", "1.
