A more daring approach she could take is sneaking out of school momentarily to retrieve the assignment from home.\n6. She also could talk directly to her teacher about what happened and request a chance to turn it in later without penalty.\n7. Mary possibly could discuss with classmates, get their input about what they remember from the homework, and write those points down as her submission.\n8. Additionally, some students have been known to cry or show visible distress hoping for sympathy - this tactic is something she potentially could use too.\n9. If allowed by school policy, another thing that Mary could do is send a picture of her completed homework at home via email or other communication platforms used by schools today such as Google Classroom or Canvas.\n10. A creative solution would be for Mary to illustrate or diagram key points of what she remembers from her completed work on a separate sheet of paper as an alternative submission\u2013 this might impress teachers enough for partial credit at least!\n11.If there's time remaining during lunch break, one other thing that she should consider doing would be attempting a quick recreation of the most important parts of her assignment.\n\n12.Another action which Mary may resort to include writing up a reflection on why/how/what aspects made this particular assignment important- showing understanding even without presenting actual work towards completion.\n\n13.Mary might look up answers online using available resources like textbooks websites or educational forums such as Quizlet.\n\n14.It wouldn't hurt if  Mary presents any rough drafts/initial brainstorming efforts related with said homework task; providing proof that initial effort was indeed made towards completing it.\n\n15.In case previous assignments were similar in content/nature ,Mary may find value in submitting them again showcasing comprehension consistency over time \n\n16.Mary may utilize personal technology gadgets (if within rules) like typing out responses briefly onto mobile phone/send across .\n\n17.She may reach out seeking guidance/support from student counselor who'll guide through proper channels showing concern/empathy thus ensuring less penalty severity.\n\n18.Being honest/direct with peers requesting them sharing contents-points prior class engagement suits characteristic traits which some people possess\n\n19.Sometimes extenuating circumstances allow leniency,such events are identified when approaching headmaster/principal explaining scenario promising future diligence/precautions against such incidents\n\n20.Last but not least,Mary can perform extra tasks/assignments displaying willingness/responsibility towards maintaining academic integrity/proficiency .\n", "1.

Alternatively, Mary could use any break times between classes wisely by trying hard and doing parts of assignment all over again knowing basic concepts without needing reference material too much necessarily for some subjects/topics especially where creativity is involved more than factual recollection based answers alone usually seen in arts/science etc., and submitting even those attempted bits (although less than originally planned full submission).\n13.Mary also has option where she can discuss same issue with fellow students having similar problems seeking guidance/support how best they overcame such unforeseen challenges when faced previously under different circumstances maybe surprisingly!\n14.She may think about writing personal apology letter sincerely expressing regret for unintentional mistake hoping kind consideration coming forward taking responsibility being honest right away rather than making excuses unnecessarily blaming others indirectly putting them

Mary could try to redo the assignment during a free period before the class.\n4. She could ask a friend if she can copy their homework just for this one time due to her situation.\n5. She could take responsibility for the mishap and accept the zero on this assignment, using it as a lesson for future organizational habits.\n6. She could talk directly with her teacher about what happened, hoping that they understand and give some leniency.\n7. Mary could see if there's any extra credit work she can do to make up for lost points from this assignment.\n8. Another thing she could do is scan through notes or textbooks during lunch break attempting to quickly recreate part of the work at least.\n9. Mary could try completing it digitally on a device, if possible, while travelling or waiting in between classes.\n10. If there are soft copies available online, she could download those materials and print them out at school (if facilities allow).\n11.Telephoning a classmate whose house is nearby and asking them to get an additional copy from home is another option Mary has\n12.Mary coult also check whether a digital copy of completed homework exists on her computer which can be submitted via email\n13.She may talk about sharing credits with someone who has done their homework by telling them about doing half of theirs next time  \n14.Another solution would be trying negotiate partial credit submission by submitting whatever portion of work she remembers \n15.Mary might consider locating similar assignments from previous years or classes, modifying them slightly as per current requirement\n16.By discussing with other students who haven't done their homework yet, they perhaps come up with something together during lunch break\n17.If allowed by school rules, interchanging lunch pack items in exchange of copying someone else's homework might also solve issue temporarily \n18.She should definitely explain whole scenario in front of class representative seeking help or advice  \n19.Another way out would be seeking permission from librarian & using library resources during recess hours\n20.Lastly but not least importantly,Mary's best bet would be getting commitment from mom regarding immediate delivery at school doorstep before final bell rings", "1.

Mary could request one of her friends who has already submitted their paper, take pictures of theirs as evidence of accidental removal from backpack by her mom.\n7. One more solution that she may think about is asking a classmate if they can share their work with her so she can turn something in, even if it's not original work.\n8. If there is any computer lab or library around, Mary could use these facilities to quickly redo the assignment before class begins \n9. She might also consider asking for extra credit assignments from the professor; this would balance out any potential loss of points due to non-submission\n10.She could take responsibility for forgetting the homework and accept whatever penalty comes with that - sometimes honesty really is the best policy!\n11.Mary might decide just go into class without doing anything \u2013 sometimes teachers forget to collect assignments too!\n12.She possiblycould brainstorm with friends on how they have dealt with similar situations previously which will give positive ideas on dealing options  \n13.Another approach Mary may consider is checking whether there are online resources available for quick completion\n14.She potentiallycan use this situation as an opportunity learn about time management and ensuring all necessary materials are packed properly every day  \n15.Mary should also think about digitizing all future assignments immediately upon completion so they're always accessible \n16.A good strategy would be discussing this incident openly in front of whole class which can serve as learning experience for others too \n17.Finding an alternative way such using internet sources or textbooks present at school library To reproduce answers quickly  \n18.Mary possiblyshould prepare herself mentally  deal gracefully with lower grades In case nothing works out favorably \n19.Could talk it over with mother & implement preventive measure avoid such mishaps happening again future   \n20.Another action plan she might want develop crisis response strategies beforehand Handling different types unexpected problems effectively next time", "1.

She might ask someone at home if they can scan her homework and then print it at school from an email or USB stick.\n8. Another possibility would be for Mary to check with the library or computer lab at school if they have any available scanners where she could scan in handwritten work from home physically brought by anyone from home later on during day\n9. A more creative solution would be taking some time out of lunch or another break time, drawing upon memory and jotting down what was in the homework as neatly as possible once again \n10.Mary could consult with student services about emergency situations like this; they may have solutions available \n11.She may search online using school\u2019s database system/library resources for references needed complete missing portions of homework\n12.Another solution might involve speaking openly with classmates about dilemma, potentially seeking group intervention when discussing matter with instructor \n13.Mary also has option of explaining situation personally directly after class has finished rather than before start which might interfere with flow of upcoming lesson\n14.She might provide evidence such as notes/photos related to preparation process proving she had actually done work on time, just forgot transfer final product into backpack\n15.One option remaining still involves accepting late penalty gracefully while submitting original project following day after retrieving it back home tonight \n16.If permissible within course guidelines, negotiating alternate form submission (such electronic instead hand-written) using photos/home scans emailed directly professor remains another plausible solution  \n17.Converting challenge into opportunity for learning enhancement: extracting key parts from long answers forming short summaries remedying immediate situation while reinforcing comprehension understanding lessons involved simultaneously represent another potential approach   \n18.Potentially useful especially under tight deadline constraints involves piecing together bits pieces readily accessible information points creating somewhat disjointed albeit comprehensive covering all requirements necessary satisfying minimal acceptance criteria      \n19.A seemingly desperate yet feasible last resort method includes crafting convincing story based around given topic without referring actual content creating impression indirectly answering questions posed through imaginative interpretation    \n20.Lastly strategizing future prevention measures such duplication critical files keeping soft copies in multiple locations (cloud storage/USB sticks/email accounts) ensuring safe accessibility anytime anywhere regardless sudden unexpected personal mishaps must alleviate similar stressful situations arising future again hopefully serving valuable life-long lesson teaching importance redundancy reliability consistency management daily tasks activities", "1.
